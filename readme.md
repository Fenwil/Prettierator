> CLI to generate a Prettier file config for each text editor plugin

### Why?
There's no prettier config file (like .eslintrc) to share along your team or your text editors

### How?
Just insert your custom parameters and it will generate a file for each plugin like:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
* [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JsPrettier)
* And more to come...

### What?
I saw an early and big adoption and wanted to make it more accessible and easy to use

### Usage
Clone or download the repo and run the following command on your terminal
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

### NPM Dependencies
* readline-sync
* jsonfile
* chalk
